# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create an interactive world map by mapping earthquakes for the Disaster Reporting Network. Our manager Basil asked us to make interactive maps informative and easy to use on the desktop or mobile phone. This will generate a positive response to our stakeholders, who can handle large amounts of data easily. with JavaScript, D3 and Mapbox with an API request. and leaflet libraries, while using GeoJson file from the USCG Eathquake Hazard Program. Our stakeholders can switch between different types of maps, choose between earthquakes for their magnitude, and add tectonic plates with a simple click. 

## Resources used
1. Vscode
2. Httml
3. D3
4. Mapbox API request
